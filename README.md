# Energy-consumption-prediction
Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a project aimed at analyzing and predicting energy consumption patterns. The primary goal of this project is to provide insights into energy usage and develop predictive models that can forecast future consumption based on historical data.

Features
Data Collection: Scripts for collecting energy consumption data from various sources, including public datasets and APIs.
Data Preprocessing: Tools for cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, including handling missing values and normalizing data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Jupyter notebooks with visualizations and statistical analyses to understand the patterns and trends in energy consumption.
Predictive Modeling: Implementation of various machine learning models to predict future energy consumption, including linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks.
Evaluation: Metrics and methods for evaluating the performance of the predictive models, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
Deployment: Scripts and configurations for deploying the predictive models into a production environment, making them accessible for real-time predictions.

Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
git clone https://github.com/ashutoasst/energy-consumption-prediction.git
cd energy-consumption-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Data Collection: Run the data collection scripts to gather the necessary data.
Data Preprocessing: Use the preprocessing tools to clean and prepare the data.
